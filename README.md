## Future Ideas
- 5 nights
	- Instead of one long night. span it across five nights
- Endless mode
	- Normally you would be in 1-5 nights. A story mode. but there would be an endless mode with a timer to see how long you last.
- Savespots.
  - tablets in story mode that let you save your progress. NOT IN ENDLESS MODE.
